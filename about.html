                    At the ICC, we strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment where students from all corners of the world can come together, forge meaningful connections, and celebrate their cultural diversity.
                    <br /> Through our carefully curated social events, we aim to promote cultural exchange, friendship, and a sense of belonging within the international student community. Moreover, the ICC serves as a crucial forum for addressing pertinent issues and concerns faced by international students.
                    <br /><br    />We actively encourage dialogue and constructive conversations to address challenges such as visa matters, academic support, cultural adaptation, and any other topics that impact the well-being and success of our students.
