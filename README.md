International Studentsâ€™ Community Center is made by international students, for international students. We hope to make the university of Manitoba feel welcoming to all the different communities and foster a hub of connection and passion. We aim to provide support to international students, as well as hold events to help build connections within and beyond the international community. 

We are here for you and each other. Feel free to contact us at any time!
